Area Plot:

An area plot, also known as an area chart or stacked area chart, is a type of data visualization that is used to display data over time or to represent the composition of a whole.
It is similar to a line chart but with the area between the line and the x-axis filled with color or shading to represent different categories or components.
Area plots are commonly used to show how different parts contribute to a whole, making it easy to compare the proportions or trends over time.
Histogram:

A histogram is a graphical representation of the distribution of data, particularly for continuous or discrete variables.
It consists of a series of bars or bins, each representing a specific range or interval of data values. The height of each bar represents the frequency or count of data points falling within that range.
Histograms are useful for visualizing the distribution of data, identifying patterns, and understanding the central tendency and spread of a dataset.
Bar Chart:

A bar chart, also known as a bar graph, is a common type of chart used to represent categorical data or to compare different categories.
It consists of rectangular bars of varying lengths, where the length of each bar corresponds to the value or frequency of the category it represents.
Bar charts can be used to compare data across categories, track changes over time, or display rankings.
In summary, these graphical representations serve different purposes:

Area plots are used to show trends over time or to visualize the composition of a whole, emphasizing the proportions of different components.
Histograms are used to visualize the distribution of data values and understand how data is spread across different ranges or intervals.
Bar charts are employed to compare different categories or items, making it easy to see differences in values or frequencies.
